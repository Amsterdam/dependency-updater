# Opdrachten Team Maintenance

This projects hosts the script we use to perform our bi-weekly maintenance. 

Each project attached must follow our specific setup:
- A make target `upgrade` must exist that updates the requirements to their latest versions.
- A make target `build` must exist that builds the docker images.
- A make target `test` must exist that runs the testcases. 

Once these succeed a new commit is created with the changes and pushed to `feature/maintenance-%y-%m-%d`.

## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@git.data.amsterdam.nl:Datapunt/opdrachten-team-maintenance.git
```

Then create a virtual environment. The virtual environment can be empty, dependencies will be installed automatically by the maintenance script.

## Usage

Simply run the maintenance script: 

```bash
./maintenance.sh
```
